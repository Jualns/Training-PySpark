## Description

Write a PySpark query to retrieve employees who earn more than the average salary of their respective department. The query should output the employee's name, department name, and salary.

We will use the provided employee and department DataFrames to solve this challenge. Finally, we'll use `display(df)` to show the final DataFrame containing the filtered employees.

## Starter Code:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Start a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Employees Above Average Salary") \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Employee DataFrame
employee_data = [
    (1, "Alice", 5000, 1),
    (2, "Bob", 7000, 2),
    (3, "Charlie", 4000, 1),
    (4, "David", 6000, 2),
    (5, "Eve", 8000, 3),
    (6, "Kev", 9000, 3),
    (7, "Mev", 10000, 3),
    (8, "Mob", 12000, 2)
]
employee_columns = ["employee_id", "employee_name", "salary", "department_id"]
emp_df = spark.createDataFrame(employee_data, employee_columns)

# Department DataFrame
department_data = [
    (1, "HR"),
    (2, "Engineering"),
    (3, "Finance")
]
department_columns = ["department_id", "department_name"]
dept_df = spark.createDataFrame(department_data, department_columns)

# Display dataframes (optional)
# emp_df.show()
# dept_df.show()

````

## Output Schema:

| Column Name     | Type   | Description                |
| :-------------- | :----- | :------------------------- |
| employee_name   | string | Name of the employee       |
| department_name | string | Name of the department     |
| salary          | int    | Salary of the employee     |

## Example Output:

| employee_name | department_name | salary |
| :------------ | :-------------- | :----- |
| Alice         | HR              | 5000   |
| Mob           | Engineering     | 12000  |
| Mev           | Finance         | 10000  |
